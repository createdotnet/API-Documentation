# Create. API Documentation

This is our beta API, which gives you access to the majority of our customers resources within the application. We plan on releasing with most of the planned resources, but some will follow in a later release, this is outlined in the introduction.

## Developers

**Not all of this API is in production.**

We are following an RDD style of development, and have written the documentation before any code. If you've been invited to view this documentation, please have a read through and let me know if you see anything that's been missed or if something doesn't make sense.
