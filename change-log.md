## v0 -> v1

### 11th June 2015 Noun Container Object
The structure now accurately represents the correct data model by containing the data in an object. For instance a list of products are now contained in a `products` object at the root of the JSON response. An individual item is contained in a singular noun i.e. `product`. 

See the documentation for details; [Products](/API-Documentation/resources/shop/products_and_categories/products.html)
